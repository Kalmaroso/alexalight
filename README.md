# Alexalight


## Introduction

We built alexalight to solve a simple problem. How do we control the lights in our house to better respond to the natrural human circadian rhythms.
Simple problem, but it wasn't such a simple solution.

## Team

Woojae Yi, Meric Bal, Matt Weingarten, Pablo Hernandez, and Joe Viveirois


## How to Use

Right now the best way to use our Alexa skills is to download them to localhost and set up an NGROK server to allow for HTTPS forwarding.


## Forthcoming Developments

- Deploy Alexa Skills to the Pyglow.com domain as an endpoint so that you can easiy acess the files without download to your machine.
